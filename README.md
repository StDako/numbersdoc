numbersdoc
==========

documentation for numbers.js. any info about contributing to the repo itself can be found at the repo's page: 
https://github.com/sjkaliski/numbers.js. as for contributing to the docs... this is written in raw HTML and made me cry a 
little inside during that time so I'll probably be changing it to use some sort of templating engine at some point.
